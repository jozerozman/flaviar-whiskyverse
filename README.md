# Flaviar frontend task

Task was done using this [boilerplate](https://github.com/ryanowich/gulp-scss-js-twig-boilerplate).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

_**Note:** if you've previously installed Gulp globally, run `npm rm --global gulp` to remove it. [Details here.](https://medium.com/gulpjs/gulp-sips-command-line-interface-e53411d4467)_

Make sure these are installed first.

-   [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
-   [Gulp Command Line Utility](http://gulpjs.com) `npm install --global gulp-cli`

### Quick Start

1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.
2. Run `nvm use` to set the correct nodejs version or set the version manually to "v10"
3. Run `npm install` to install required files and dependencies.
4. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
    - `gulp` manually compiles files.
    - `gulp watch` automatically compiles files and applies changes using [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) when you make changes to your source files.
